#Why couldn't you have stuck to bike lanes?
How does it feel to have broken the UK in a failed bit to be PM?
Britain was better off when all you could screw up was TfL
#You broke Britain. You know that.
#Your brexit mistakes will keep history PhD students busy in decades to come
Your family Xmas Day will be as tense as boxing day with Cameron

#Every day that you don't start a war with an EU27 country must count as a success

#Bad news: there is is no cake to eat
#Ironically, your backing of brexit may do more for Irish unification than Cameron did
You'll be remembered for 2 good works, 3 wrecks: Bikes, Bike Lanes, Garden Bridge, Cable Car, Brexit
Still waiting for BMW to get Merkel to offer zero tariff trading terms.
Is it true you've been locked in a cupboard in Cornwall?
Are you standing as the UKIP or Conservative candidate for Uxbridge?

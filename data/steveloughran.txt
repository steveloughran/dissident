You broke the build
If you can read this, it means your house hasn't burned down —yet
You are running out of witty things to say
It happens sometimes. People just explode. Natural causes
You ever feel as if your mind had started to erode?
You don't even know what's in your own trunk! And you know what? I think you're afraid to find out!
In this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend. Those that come in by the door; those that come in by the window.
Don't listen to him, no really. You're better off not listening.
